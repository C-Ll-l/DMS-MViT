# DMS-MViT

This code is based on the MMPretrain framework and we provide the core code for the model.MMPretrain is a newly upgraded open-source framework for pre-training. It has set out to provide multiple powerful pre-trained backbones and support different pre-training strategies. It is a part of the OpenMMLab project developed by Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK.And the print file for model complexity analysis is provided.

The rest of the code, and training environment information, is currently being collated and will be made public when the paper is accepted.
